## Getting Started
### Example App
Before registering your own app (which costs 6 STEEM) you can experiment with SteemConnect V2 development using the following demo:

- [https://steemit.github.io/sc2-angular](https://steemit.github.io/sc2-angular)

### Register Your App
Once you are ready to register your own app to use with SteemConnect V2 you can do so by following these steps:

1. Go to https://v2.steemconnect.com/dashboard to register a new app to use with SteemConnect V2. Note that this will cost 6 STEEM since it will actually create a new Steem account for your app.

2. Click on "My Apps" and then "+ New App" to set up a new app.

3. Enter a name for your new app's Steem account. A popular convention is [app_name].app, for example Busy.org uses busy.app.

4. Pay the 6 STEEM account creation fee.

5. Fill out the information for your app such as name, description, icon, and website.

6. Add any URIs you will use for your site to the Redirect URI(s) list. SteemConnect will only allow redirects to a URI specified here. If you are developing locally you will need to include the local URL you are using in this list for testing.

7. Your app should now be registered and you can start developing.

### Include the SC2 SDK in your HTML page
```
<script src="https://steemit.github.io/sc2-angular/sc2.min.js"></script>
```

## SDK Documentation
### Init SDK
Call the init() method when your app first loads to initialize the SDK:
```
sc2.init({
  app: 'busy',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8000/demo/',
  accessToken: 'access_token',
  scope: ['vote', 'comment']
});
```
Parameters:
- __app__: This is the name of the app that was registered in the SteemConnect V2 dashboard
- __callbackURL__: This is the URL that users will be redirected to after interacting with SC2. It must be listed in the "Redirect URI(s)" list in the app settings EXACTLY the same as it is specified here
- __accessToken__: If you have an oauth2 access token for this user already you can specify it here, otherwise you can leave it and set it later using sc2.setAccessToken(accessToken).
- __scope__: This is a list of operations the app will be able to access on the user's account. For a complete list of scopes see: [https://github.com/steemit/steemconnect/wiki/OAuth-2#scopes](https://github.com/steemit/steemconnect/wiki/OAuth-2#scopes)

### Get Login URL
The following method returns a URL that you can redirect the user to so that they may log in to your app through SC2:
```
var link = sc2.getLoginUrl(state);
console.log(link)
// => https://v2.steemconnect.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[app]&redirect_uri=[callbackURL]&scope=vote,comment&state=[state]
```

### Get user profile
```
sc2.me(function (err, res) {
  console.log(err, res)
});
```

### Vote
```
sc2.vote(voter, author, permlink, weight, function (err, res) {
  console.log(err, res)
});
```

### Logout
```
sc2.revokeToken(function (err, res) {
  console.log(err, res)
});
```

### Generate hot signing link
```
var link = sc2.sign('transfer', {
  to: 'fabien',
  amount: '1.000 STEEM',
  memo: 'Hello World!',
});

console.log(link);
// => https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/transfer?to=fabien&amount=1.000%20STEEM&memo=Hello%20World!
```
